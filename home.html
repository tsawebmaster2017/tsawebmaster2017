					<a name="brief">Design Brief</a>
				</h2>
				<p>Imagine that you are walking down the street to a local cafe that you enjoy. As you start your walk you happen to pass another brand new cafe that just opened across the street. While you do enjoy the warm familiarity of you local, the idea of a new cafe interests you greatly. But, before you make you decision, you put on your glasses and look at the sign of the brand new cafe. There right before your eyes comes review after terrible review of  the new cafe’s coffee, tea, pastries, and other wares. After lifting your glasses of your face in disgust, you rush over to your regular cafe, welcomed by the aroma of edible pastries, the smell of delicious coffee, and the smile of your favorite barista. This is only one of the many applications of a relatively new type of technology, called augmented reality.
<br><br>
As shown by the example above, augmented reality allows users to access real life background information on what they are viewing in real time. It can give you information on the architecture of a building, or information on the events near your location, or even give you a play by play during a soccer game. In more serious situations, augmented reality can be used to help pilots keep their eyes on the sky while also keeping the updated on every aspect of the plane they are flying.
<br><br>
Because of the fact that there are varied uses for augmented reality, there is also a myriad of technology used to suit the needs of different people. For common citizens, augmented reality can be used on their smartphones via pictures, a phone’s GPS, and vastness of the google search engine. More specifically,  if you take a picture of a certain location, google can use your gps location and search complete an image search in order to give you more information whatever you took a picture of. In addition to using your phone’s GPS, many phone applications, like SnapChat can overlay filters on videos or pictures that you take on your phone. Google Glass and HUDs (heads-up displays) are types of headwear that can be utilized to pull up information in real time as a person is going about their day or, like in the example above, flying an airplane.
<br><br>
There are many pros to augmented reality one of them being the fact that they allow users to experience the world around them without leaving their homes. Augmented reality can allow users to see and learn more about the environment they are interested in through background information or by giving them a virtual tour of places around the world. Augmented reality can also make training surgeons and military personnel more efficient and safer both occupations. This is due to the fact that augmented reality can provide instant results and analyze outcomes during the training sessions. The feedback that the occupants get helps them understand their shortcomings and work harder to overcome them.
<br><br>
While augmented reality may seem perfect for our society, it does have some cons associated with it. One of them being the fact that it invades the privacy of the user and can be prone to data hacks. The leak of personal information is a big deal to many and there are fears that their information may be used by authorities to track or control them. Another con is the fact that since it is possible to experience the world from home, people may begin not interacting with the environment around them. This may seem like a large claim but augmented reality may hamper in person socialization which is a big concern in the field.
